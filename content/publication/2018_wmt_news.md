abstract = "In this article we describe the TALP-UPC research group participation in the WMT18 news shared translation task for Finnish-English and Estonian-English within the multi-lingual subtrack.  All of our primary submissions implement an attention-based Neural Machine Translation architecture.  Given that Finnish and Estonian belong to the same language family and are similar, we use as training data the combination of the datasets of both language pairs to paliate the data scarceness of each individual pair.  We also report the translation quality of systems trained on individual language pair data to serve as baseline and comparison reference."
