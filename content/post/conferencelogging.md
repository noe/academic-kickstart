I have recently started attending scientific conferences. I had the need to log what
I was seeing and learning, and the ideas that came to my mind. I wanted also to
take pictures of oral presentations and posters so that I could later check them
out. Maybe there are better solutions out there, but I devised my own. Here I
explain it.
