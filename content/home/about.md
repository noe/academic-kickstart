# Biography

I am currently an entrepreneur. I just founded [Learnik](https://www.learnik.com), a language
learning app that is free for students.

I hold a PhD in Neural Machine Translation from the
[Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu/?set_language=en) in Barcelona.


I have been a software developer for most of my life, then data scientist, then
researcher and now entrepreneur.
