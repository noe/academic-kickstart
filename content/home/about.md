# Biography

I am currently a PhD candidate on Neural Machine Translation at the
[Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu/?set_language=en) in Barcelona.
I am conducting my research under the supervision of Professors
[Marta Ruiz Costa-Jussà](http://www.costa-jussa.com/) and
José Adrian Rodríguez Fonollosa, in the [Language and Speech Technologies
and Applications (TALP) research group](http://www.talp.upc.edu/).


I have been a software developer for most of my life, then data scientist
and now I have turned back to academia to take on my _long-cherished_
dream to become a researcher on machine learning and artificial intelligence.


My research lines focus on Neural Machine Translation (NMT).
Lately I am interested on _injecting_ prior linguistic knowledge into neural networks,
specifically on
hybridizing rule-based machine translation systems with NMT.
